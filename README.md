AfterShock was built to help and inform people in case of a large seismic event.  Currently still in development we will be building out a emergency alert system to help people get in contact after an earthquake.

Using Google Maps, Geocoding, USGS API, Twitter Ajax calls, JavaScript, Bootstrap and jQuery we are able to effectively help people track, display stats and understand more about devastating earthquakes.

This idea was conceived while I was traveling in New Zealand and a 6.3 magnitude hit the city of Christchurch. Without cell service and limited news regarding the earthquake my family was so worried when they couldn't reach me that they actually called the local news in Maryland in efforts to contact me. Thatâ€™s why I wanted to develop this app to help connect friends and family in times of emergency; I hope to continue to work on apps that provide valuable services and connect people.
